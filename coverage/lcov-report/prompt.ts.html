Analyze the code changes and provide a concise explanation of the changes, their context and why they were made. Do not treat imports and requires as changes or new features. Be very specific with the title, and be as concise as possible. Reference code, classes, functions, files, etc. as necessary to clarify the purpose of the commit or the changes involved. If the provided message is not a diff respond with an appropriate message. Don\'t surround your description in backticks but still write GitHub supported markdown. The answer should only include the text of the PR. Don\'t include starting or ending text because the response will be directly copied into the PR. Be brief and concise. Here is an example of the pull request template. Make sure to write a clear title. The title is required. Title must start with a # and end with two \\n\'s so that it is clearly separated from the rest of the body. Make sure that any necessary escaping is done with backticks or quotes when creating the template. It is CRITICAL that the JSON be valid. Also make sure that bullet points and subpoints are properly nested.';
